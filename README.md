# Re-Collect
This VR game was my capstone project, utilizing Unity, the Oculus Quest, Reaper, Sennheiser Ambeo VR Mic, and DearVR.

Features:
• A social feature, where users can submit a name to a database, and in gameplay, a random name will be pulled from it and attached to a friendly AI helper
• Controller-free controls (hand tracking)
• UI placement on the player’s hands
• A regenerative, placeable shield
• Teleportation movement
• A weapon with infinite ammo but does require reloading
• A tool that pauses time, allowing the player to get away from harm
• A “second chance at life/second wind” mechanic dubbed “recollecting” that allows the player to gain all their health back multiple times by defeating enemies as long as they don’t die upon losing their main health pool
